[B]Description and Personality:[/B]
[tab][/tab]Focused, determined, and dependable, Kiara works hard to accomplish whatever she has set out to do. While she is not a visionary, she has strong convictions and beliefs and follows them with unwavering certainty. In particular, Kiara fiercely detests slavery and any other kind of deplorable treatment of persons otherwise. Though Kiara can sometimes be a bit headstrong, she is loyal to her friends, trusting their wisdom and leadership, especially in difficult situations.

Kiara's appearance leaves mixed impressions. On the one hand, she holds her head high with facial features that suggest she comes from noble stock. On the other hand, she frequently wears plain working garments that reveal a more working class background. Her hands are strong and callused, and her arms bear the marks of manual labor--including several notable burns from the smithing kiln.

When Kiara travels, she always carries a well-polished shield with an image of [TT="hawthorne berries"][IMG]https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/07/53/12/240_F_107531296_cTbn1i2fRtbwsEvTvnkxuIrX40DQiEnA.jpg[/IMG][/TT] emblazoned on the front.

[b]Five Most Important Things to Know About Kiara:[/b]
[SPOILERBUTTON=Who is Kiara H. Elthundra?][LIST=1]
[*][b]Born into Nobility, Lived life as a Serf:[/b] Kiara was born into the noble Elthundra family in Saja, a family with a certain amount of magical talent. However, when she was 10 years old, her family was publicly executed by a neighboring household, the house of Camen, in a political squabble. Kiara was spared, either in some act of sudden pity or the opinion that forcing her to work as a serf was better punishment. Thus began the tyrannical reign of terror in what had previously been her home.
- 
[*][b]Fears Guillotines and Public Executions:[/b] The Camen's forced Kiara to watch the public execution of her family. This has left its mark on Kiara. Through a significant amount of training and stubbornness, Kiara has overcome a fear of blades, blood, brutal injuries, and death. However, she still gets queasy whenever she is forced to watch the killing of helpless individuals and she can do nothing to help them. And sometimes when she sees a guillotine. But who uses those these days?
-
[*][b]A Shield and Fists Over Blades:[/b] Perhaps because of her experience watching her family member's heads lopped off, Kiara abstains from using any form of [TT="sharp bladed objects in battle"]i.e., items with the "slashing" characteristic[/TT]. This was somewhat of a contentious issue when she was training in the Resistance Movement against the Camen's; after all, how could someone unwilling to pick up a sword be of any use as a fighter? Nonetheless, Kiara demonstrated through her diligent training with her fists and her natural talent with shields, that she could be both a brutal and effective fighter. Closing distance swiftly, protecting herself from harm with her shield-bearing arm, bashing wrong-doers with shield, knee, and elbow, Kiara has developed a unique fighting style that startles foes and often gives her an edge in a fight.
-
[*][b]Sisters of the Grove:[/b] Three women were mainly responsible for stripping the Camens' authority and power in Kiara's home: Cybil Greyhawk, Mubina Talys, and Kiara herself. The Greyhawk's were another noble house vying for power in the region, and Cybil was instrumental in the politics and stabilization of Kiara's home before and after the ousting of the Camens. Mubina Talys is talented magician from a guild in Cordania who, while passing through this corner of Saja, became invested in helping the Resistance. Through Cybil's leadership, Mubina's cunning, and Kiara's stubbornness, many of the obstacles that were preventing change were toppled. The three women are best of friends and sworn sisters. As part of their bond of sisterhood, each woman adopted a different tree as their symbol of power, friendship, and unofficial crest. Kiara's [TT="symbol"]Cybil's is an Oak tree and Mubina's is a Linden tree[/TT] is the [TT="hawthorne tree"][IMG]http://treecouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hawthorn.jpg[/IMG][/TT].
-
[*][b]Life as a Smith:[/b] Despite her noble heritage, Kiara has never sought a role as leader or pursued her rightful place at court. Instead, Kiara prefers the peace and stability of working hard with her body and hands. In the most recent years since the Camens were ousted, Kiara has taken up blacksmithing as her main profession and she loves it. For Kiara, there is something deeply satisfying and meditative about working with the forge. If she ever gets a chance, she would love nothing better than to visit the fires and kilns of some of the more famous dwarven smiths in the world, to witness and admire their handiwork.

[FIELDSET="Headed for Cordania"][tab][/tab]Kiara is still surprised to be headed towards Cordania. Having recently finished her apprenticeship as a blacksmith, Kiara had expected to settle down somewhere and start her own humble business, not be traveling to the one of the biggest cities/trade hubs in the world.

The reason for her spontaneous journey was simple: several weeks ago, she had received a letter from one of her best friends and sworn sister, Mubina Talys. She recognized Mubina's seal immediately, the single leaf and [TT="flowers of a linden tree"][IMG]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSS45fd6C3BHU2NNLkIa90PI1aQvHYJOuj4Sr9VqilE4OiZnmLG[/IMG][/TT] stamped prominently in red. Inside was written clearly in Mubina's handwriting:

[CENTER][SIZE="3"][FONT="Book Antiqua"][I]"Kiara, you must come to Cordania as soon as you are able. If you need assistance arranging travel, our dearest sister will be sure to help you."
--With Love, Sister of the Linden[/I][/FONT][/SIZE][/CENTER]

There was no question in Kiara's mind about what to do next. If Mubina was summoning her, she would travel to the ends of the earth to help her. What did bother Kiara, was the fact that Mubina hadn't signed her name. And the summons had been pretty vague. What could be troubling Mubina that she hadn't written Kiara in more detail?

Kiara did as the letter instructed and went to meet with her other sworn sister and friend, Cybil Greyhawk. It seemed that Cybil was as puzzled by the letter as Kiara. Nonetheless Cybil helped make arrangements for Kiara to head to Cordania, and a few days later, here she was on a boat traveling to Cordania. What fate would meet her there, Kiara could hardly fathom. However, if her sister Mubina was in trouble, Kiara would take up her Shield again to protect her friend.

[FIELDSET="Character History"][b]Living Under the Tyranny of the Camens:[/b]
[SPOILERBUTTON=Memory of Death][FIELDSET="Memory of Death"][tab][/tab]The single most salient memory Kiara has from her childhood is the thunk of a guillotine blade as it strikes the wood below it, followed by a head of someone she cares about rolling like a marble along the ground.

Kiara was born into the noble family of Elthundra in a largely ignored region of Saja. This is probably why no one noticed or cared when a neighboring household, the house of Camens, invaded the Elthundra's estate, publicly executed her family, and claimed all of the Elthundra's territory as their own. In the current day and age, such squabbles between noble families, while not always quite as bloody, are fairly common and could easily be overlooked by the King and court, especially since the Camens still swore their fealty to the current king of Saja.

She was 10 when the Camens slaughtered her family, and the memory still haunts her dreams on occasion. She remembers trying to look away from the guillotine, hot tears rushing down her face. She remembers the executioner laughing cruelly and holding down her head and forcing her to watch as one by one, each of her family members were decapitated.

Probably on a whim, Kiara was spared the guillotine. Instead, she was forced to join the serfs in the fields to do what the Camens imagined must be the most humiliating labor of punishment. However, from Kiara's perspective, compared to what she had just been forced to witness, working like a slave from sunup to sundown could hardly be called punishment.[/FIELDSET][/SPOILERBUTTON]
[SPOILERBUTTON=Viciousness and Terror][FIELDSET="Viciousness and Terror"][tab][/tab]Often times when one family of nobles is replaced by another family of nobles, very little changes in the daily life of the people living on the land. However, when the Camens took over, things changed. The Elthundra's had not been "nice" to the people per se, but they had not been cruel. When the Camens came to power in this region, they made lives hard for the people. In addition to over-taxation, the Camens also began selling children from the serfs to slave traders to assuage their desire for profit and greed.

For many of the tenants of the land, this was not only unsavory, but unacceptable. When Kiara was 13, she remembers the her people were planning an uprising. She also remembers the hangings and public executions that followed when the instigators were caught. While she was not forced to keep her eyes open and watch, all of the serfs were required to be present, and she remembers throwing up in a bucket in one of the town squares for the whole duration.

Over the next few years, the Camens continued to use fear and cruelty to keep the peasants, serfs, and other common folk in line. In this time of fear and terror, Kiara Elthundra was completely forgotten. Kiara followed the rules, worked hard, and silently watched the pain and suffering of her peers. In some ways, she almost began to forget that she had ever been lived anywhere else but the shacks the serfs were allotted for cooking and sleeping.[/FIELDSET][/SPOILERBUTTON]
[b]Joining the Resistance:[/b]
[SPOILERBUTTON=Leaving Serfdom Behind][FIELDSET="Leaving Serfdom Behind"][tab][/tab]It was several years before there was again any talk of revolting against the Camens' rule. Mistakes were learned from: the "Resistance," as it was called, was far more secretive and elusive. Organizing was secretive and discussions were held furtively, if at all.

Kiara herself had mostly resigned herself to her lot in life. Except for there was a boy, Jake, one of her only friends, who seemed to have hope that things could be different. He was going to join the Resistance, he would say to her in confidence. While most of the time she felt he was being naive, sometimes, her heart would open and she could share in his hopes and dreams.

Kiara had just turned 17 when Kiara was again forced to witness something precious being taken from her again. One of the personal guards from the house of Camen had decided that this boy, Jake, would be the perfect way to vent his frustrations over not getting a promotion. Kiara joined the circle of commotion only in time to catch Jake's eyes as the guard drove his sword through the boy's back. [b]"Run, Kiara,"[/b] Jake's eyes seemed to say, [b]"Find the resistance. Make the dream of a better life a reality!"[/b]

Even though no words were spoken, something snapped within Kiara. So she began to run. She ignored the fact that her coworkers might be punished for her absence, might be forced to endure more of her share of labor, or worse. She ignored the fact that she had no plan, that she herself knew nothing about the resistance, that she had no food, nor extra sets of clothing.

Somehow she had made it deep into the nearby woods but she was lost, exhausted, and crying profusely. Then, through a serendipitous turn of fate, a woman appeared in the moonlight. It was Mubina Talys, a traveling magician from Cordania. Mubina offered Kiara a kind and gentle hand. In that magical moment, Kiara saw for the first time truly what hope looked like. Kiara took Mubina's hand and never looked back.[/FIELDSET][/SPOILERBUTTON]
[b]Fighting for Change:[/b]
[SPOILERBUTTON=Shield of the Resistance][FIELDSET="Shield of the Resistance"][tab][/tab]Mubina brought Kiara to the Resistance movement. Unlike previously when the previous revolt which had been mostly instigated by unhappy serfs and common folk in the region, the Resistance had the backing of another noble family: the Greyhawks. This meant that there was an official training militia, weapons, and other resources available to the Resistance that made the chance of success in ousting the Camens much more of a reality.

Kiara had a great deal of difficulty adjusting to the militia training of the Resistance. In the first place, she had a great aversion to anything with a sharp edge. About the only thing she had going for her was the fact that she was focused and a hard worker. This persistence, however, saw her through. While she never developed skill with blades of any sort, she did overcome her avoidance of them through extensive practice work with a shield. In fact, she very quickly became skilled enough to best many of her instructors with only her fists, a shield, and sheer force of will.

This caught the eye of Cybil Greyhawk, youngest daughter of the Greyhawk family and the main contact the Resistance had with the family. Cybil appreciated Kiara's strong work ethic and her determination to help change her circumstances. When requiring an escort, Cybil frequently called upon Kiara to be her shield and the two women quickly became friends. Together with Mubina, the trio of women became inseparable whenever their paths allowed them to be in the same camp.

Mubina also was interested in Kiara's background and was surprised to find out that Kiara had been from the Elthundra family. After some investigation and experimentation, they discovered that Kiara had indeed inherited some of the magical skill passed down through her blood kin. After a bit of training, this also became a skill Kiara could call upon during missions to assist the resistance.[/FIELDSET][/SPOILERBUTTON]
[SPOILERBUTTON=End of the Camens][FIELDSET="End of the Camens"][tab][/tab]It took three years for the Resistance to fully prepare for a full conflict with the Camens. However, during the fourth year, a series of coordinated battles and skirmishes eventually led to the capture of the heads of the Camen household. It was common knowledge by this point that the Greyhawks had backed the revolts, and it was no surprise when they took over control of the region. Almost everyone involved though were immediately thankful to once again be under the rule of reasonable and honorable family.

In the aftermath, despite generous other generous offers from Cybil Greyhawk, all Kiara asked for was her freedom from serfdom and a recommendation for an apprenticeship with a local blacksmith in the region. Kiara had been through a lot in her youth and wanted a chance to settle down and live a normal life, at least for a while. As both a friend and as a leader, Cybil felt that this was certainly the least she could do to help Kiara.

Since relative peace returned to Kiara's homeland, Kiara has been working as a blacksmith. Mubina returned to Cordania, and of course Cybil is involved in her family's leadership, rule, and politics in Saja. Kiara recently finished her apprenticeship and was deciding what to do next when she received the letter of summons from Mubina.[/FIELDSET][/SPOILERBUTTON]
[/FIELDSET]
[FIELDSET="Roleplay Sample"][b]Storming Wendrick Camen's Manor:[/b]
[tab][/tab]This memory is from when Kiara was storming Wendrick Camen's manor during the last few battles of the revolt against the Camens. Together with Cybil Greyhawk, Mubina Talys, and a group of other Resistance fighters, they had succeeded in bashing down the gates and were headed towards the main hall for a big clash with the last of Wendrick's personal guard.
[SPOILERBUTTON=And... Scene!][FIELDSET="Overcoming the Legacy of the Past"]Kiara turned the corner into the courtyard and immediately froze in her tracks. She'd known that Wendrick Camen had favored his uncle's use of the guillotine, she'd known that there would likely be one here in this very courtyard and yet...

[CENTER][SIZE="1"][COLOR="Purple"][b]"Kiara! Kiara![/b][/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]

Someone was calling her name, but all she could hear was the fearful silence which preceded death. The heavy blade suspended precariously above her older brother's face...

[CENTER][COLOR="Purple"][b]"KIARA!"[/b][/COLOR][/CENTER]

Why couldn't she remember his name? She could remember his face so clearly as it rolled across the wooden planks, face frozen in an image of terror. He'd been her older brother but she couldn't remember his name!

[CENTER][SIZE="3"][COLOR="Purple"][b]"KIARA! Watch out!"[/b][/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]

Instinct taking over, Kiara raised her shield just in time to parry the guard's blade quickly dropping towards her face. However, she was too slow to move out of the way of the guard's kick and found herself staggering backwards, the wind briefly knocked out of her. She looked up to see the man drawing back his sword to slice her throat, just as her brother's throat had been sliced.

[I]'Alexander,'[/i] she thought. That had been her brother's name. Alexander.

Suddenly, Cybil was there, charging into the man knocking him back and away from Kiara. A comforting hand was placed on Kiara's back and she felt a renewal of strength. She turned to face Mubina only to meet an open hand slapping across her face.

[COLOR="Purple"][b]"Get yourself together Kiara!"[/b][/COLOR] Mubina said, comforting her and commanding her at the same time, [COLOR="Purple"][b]"If you want to see this through to the end, you need to stand up and face your past!"[/b][/COLOR]

Kiara still felt the sting of her best friends hand smarting her cheek. She shook her head and focused her vision on the members of the Resistance crossing blades with the Camen's personal guards. Mubina was right: it was time for Kiara to face her past. This was why she was here. She was going to see the end of the Camen's reign of terror.

[b]"Thanks, Mubina,"[/b] Kiara said simply. Her friend smiled back at her and the two gripped each others forearms firmly. Mubina helped Kiara stand and steady herself. 

Kiara raised her chin high and looked her friend and mentor in the eye, [b]"Remind me how we started the campfire last night."[/b]

Mubina nodded in understanding, twisting her arm in the relevant hand motions and whispering the intention in her mind. [TT="Sparks danced off Mubina's fingers"]as the Spark spell[/TT].

[b]"Excellent,"[/b] Kiara responded, [b]"Because the courtyard is rather cold, and I believe someone has provided us with a perfect tinderbox for this occasion."[/b][/FIELDSET]

[FIELDSET="DM Hooks and Secrets"][SECRET="Pendragon"][SPOILERBUTTON=DM Hooks and Comments][LIST]
[*][b]Mubina Talys:[/b] I left the reason Mubina summoned Kiara vague, mostly because I don't know what you have in store for us. Feel free to work this into the script or not as you see fit! If you are interested in more details of what I imagined about Mubina, let me know, otherwise this can fall to the wayside.
-
[*][b]Magical Lineage:[/b] Kiara doesn't know everything about her family's history, but does know that her family had some strong magic in their blood. Mubina has told her at least this much. One reason that Mubina could have summoned Kiara is because Mubina discovered something else about Kiara's family history. Just another possible hook, if you want to use it!
-
[*][b]Disgust with executions and dislike of blades:[/b] Feel free to make use of these as if they were actual flaws. It made sense for my character.
